## Start Doing

​

## Lessons Learned

- Eventhough we dont all have the same schedule, we need to put in the time

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- More or less the whole planning part went as expected

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- When working in a group it is important that all agree on the way things are
divided between team members and everyone has to work on the planning and
collaboration part as much as the design part

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- Our development strategy is more detailed this time

### Or remove extra steps?

- Not remove steps but doing the planning went easier this time because we had
tried it before, practise makes us better
